# 🌐 Hub-and-Spoke Architecture in AWS

## 📘 Overview

The **Hub-and-Spoke model** is a widely adopted network and account structure in AWS. It is especially useful in multi-account environments managed through **AWS Organizations**, **AWS Control Tower**, or **Landing Zone** setups.

In this model:

- The **Hub account** acts as a **central service provider**.
- The **Spoke accounts** are **isolated environments** (like dev, test, prod) that **consume shared services** from the hub.

## 🧱 Structure

```plaintext
AWS Organizations (Root Account)
│
├── Security OU
│   ├── Log Archive Account
│   └── Audit Account
│
├── Shared Services OU (Hub)
│   └── Shared Services Account
│       ├── Logging
│       ├── Monitoring
│       ├── Central Networking (VPC, Transit Gateway)
│       ├── DNS (Route 53)
│       └── Security Tools (GuardDuty, Config, Security Hub)
│
└── Workload OU (Spokes)
    ├── Dev Account
    ├── Test Account
    ├── Prod Account

```

## 🏢 Real-World Analogy

Imagine the Hub is your company's main office, and the Spokes are your branch offices:

**The main office has:**
- Internet access
- Printers
- Security team

**Branch offices (teams) connect to the main office to:**
- Access internet
- Print documents
- Get security monitoring

---

## ⚙️ Hub Account Responsibilities

The Hub (a dedicated AWS account) typically hosts:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Central VPC / Transit Gateway | To route traffic between accounts securely |
| Centralized Logging (S3) | Store all logs (CloudTrail, VPC flow logs) |
| CloudWatch / AWS Config | Unified monitoring and compliance |
| Route 53 DNS | Shared DNS across accounts |
| IAM or SSO (optional) | Central identity access management |

---

## 🚀 Spoke Account Responsibilities

Each Spoke account:

- Is used for running workloads (e.g., applications, pipelines)
- Connects to the Hub to use shared services like internet access, DNS, or logging
- Is isolated to enforce least privilege and security boundaries

**Common spoke accounts:**
- `dev`
- `test`
- `prod`
- `analytics`

---

## ✅ Benefits of Hub-and-Spoke

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Centralized Security** | All logs and monitoring are centralized in one place |
| 🌍 **Unified Networking** | Use a single VPC or TGW across environments |
| 💰 **Cost Efficiency** | Avoid duplicate NAT Gateways, GuardDuty charges, etc. |
| 📏 **Easier Governance** | Apply policies and controls from a central account |
| 🧼 **Clean Separation** | Keep environments isolated while using shared services |

---

## ❌ Without Hub-and-Spoke (Flat Model)

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| 🔁 **Duplication of resources** | Every account manages its own VPC, logs, security, etc |
| 🔐 **Fragmented security** | No unified monitoring/logging |
| 📉 **Poor scalability** | Harder to manage 10s or 100s of accounts individually |

---

## 📌 When to Use Hub-and-Spoke

✅ **Highly recommended when:**

- Using AWS Control Tower
- Building a Landing Zone
- Managing 3 or more AWS accounts
- Enforcing governance, compliance, or security standards

- Set up centralized logging bucket
- Configure Transit Gateway or VPC peering

### 3. Configure Spoke Accounts
- Create individual accounts for each environment
- Establish connectivity to hub
- Configure local resources

### 4. Implement Cross-Account Roles
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::HUB-ACCOUNT-ID:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧱 What You'll Typically Have

### 🏢 Hub Account (`shared-services`)

Responsible for shared services across the organization:

- 🏗️ **Central VPC** with public/private subnets
- 🌐 **NAT Gateway / Transit Gateway**
- 🌍 **Route 53** for private hosted zones (DNS)
- 📜 **CloudTrail + AWS Config** for centralized auditing
- 🔐 **GuardDuty, Security Hub, IAM Access Analyzer** for security monitoring
- 📂 **S3 Bucket** for centralized logging
- 🔐 **IAM roles & SCPs** (optional for governance)

---

### 🚀 Spoke Accounts (`dev`, `test`, `prod`)

Dedicated accounts for running workloads. These accounts:

- Run only **application workloads**
- Have **no local NAT Gateway**
- Use **Transit Gateway** to route internet and VPC traffic via the Hub
- Send all logs to the **S3 bucket in the Hub account**
- Use shared **Route 53 DNS** zones from the Hub

---

## 🔌 How to Connect Spoke to Hub

| Component     | Integration Method                                                |

## 📂 Example Directory Structure (Terraform)

```bash
.
├── hub-account/
│   ├── vpc.tf
│   ├── logging.tf
│   └── security.tf
├── spoke-dev/

## Best Practice (AWS Landing Zone & Control Tower)
When using AWS Landing Zone or Control Tower, AWS automatically creates these accounts:

| Account                 | Default Role                          | OU (Recommended)    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `Log Archive`           | Store all CloudTrail, Config, S3 logs | `Security OU`       |
| `Audit`                 | Read-only access, security tooling    | `Security OU`       |
| `Shared Services` (Hub) | Networking, DNS, NAT, etc.            | `Infrastructure OU` |
| `Dev`, `Test`, `Prod`   | Workload accounts                     | `Workloads OU`      |
```
AWS Organizations (Root)
│
├── Security OU
│   ├── log-archive
│   └── audit
│
├── Infrastructure OU
│   └── shared-services (Hub)
│
├── Workloads OU
│   ├── dev
│   ├── test
│   └── prod
```
✅ You can manage networking, security, logging, IAM, CI/CD, backups, monitoring, and billing from a central Hub account, while Spoke accounts focus only on workloads.
