# 🔐 IAM User/Role vs AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)

This document explains the key differences between traditional **IAM Users/Roles** and the newer **AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)**, helping you decide when to use which approach for managing access to AWS accounts and services.

---

## 📘 What is IAM?

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely using:

- **IAM Users**: Identities with long-term credentials (username/password, access keys).
- **IAM Roles**: Identities with temporary credentials, used by AWS services or federated identities.

---

## 📘 What is AWS IAM Identity Center?

**IAM Identity Center (SSO)** is a centralized way to manage access to multiple AWS accounts and applications for **workforce users** via **federation** or **native directory integration**.

It supports:
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Fine-grained permission sets
- Multi-account access with ease
- Integration with external IdPs (e.g., Azure AD, Okta)

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature / Aspect                    | IAM User / Role                            | IAM Identity Center (SSO)                           |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 🔑 Credential Type                 | Long-term (user); Temporary (role)         | Temporary credentials managed by Identity Center    |
| 👤 User Management                 | Managed manually per AWS account           | Centralized via directory or identity source        |
| 🔄 Federation Support             | Requires manual SAML/OIDC setup            | Built-in integration with external IdPs             |
| 🧭 Multi-Account Access            | Complex with roles or access keys          | Native multi-account access with permission sets    |
| 🧹 Lifecycle Management           | Manual (create/delete users)               | Integrated with corporate identity directories      |
| 📜 Policy Attachments              | Inline/managed IAM policies                | Permission sets mapped to users/groups              |
| 🔐 MFA Enforcement                 | Per account/user                           | Centralized enforcement across accounts             |
| 🧰 Developer/Programmatic Access  | Yes (via access keys or role assumption)   | Yes (via CLI/profile integration using `aws sso`)   |
| 🎯 Use Case                        | Granular service access; automation scripts| Workforce user access to AWS Console/CLI            |

## ✅ When to Use What?

| Use Case                                      | Recommended Solution              |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CI/CD, automation, services (e.g., Lambda)   | **IAM Roles**                     |
| Programmatic access with fine control        | **IAM Users + Access Keys** *(limited)* |
| Centralized workforce access (multi-account) | **IAM Identity Center (SSO)**     |
| Integration with enterprise IdP              | **IAM Identity Center (SSO)**     |
| Delegating access between AWS accounts       | **IAM Roles with trust policies** |

---

## 🔧 Example Scenarios

- ✅ Use **IAM Role** when an EC2 instance needs to access S3.
- ✅ Use **IAM User** for a developer writing automation scripts (limited use; AWS recommends temporary credentials).
- ✅ Use **IAM Identity Center** to allow employees to log in to multiple AWS accounts with their corporate credentials.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Avoid IAM users with long-term access keys.
- Prefer **IAM roles** and **temporary credentials**.
- Use **IAM Identity Center** for human users whenever possible.
- Use **Permission boundaries** and **least privilege** principles.

#### ✅ Do NOT use the root account (management account) for access management or daily operations.Instead, create a dedicated account under the Security OU (or a separate Access OU) specifically for Access Management (Identity).

### 🏗️ Recommended Setup

AWS Organizations (Root / Management Account)   ❌ Do not use for day-to-day operations
│
├── Security OU
│   ├── log-archive         ✅ Collects CloudTrail logs, config, etc.
│   ├── audit               ✅ Read-only access for auditing
│   └── identity-center     ✅ Access Management Account (IAM Identity Center)
│
├── Infrastructure OU
│   └── shared-services     ✅ Hub VPC, Transit Gateway, DNS, AD, etc.
