# Istio

**Istio's Purpose:** Istio is a service mesh technology, providing management of service-to-service communications for microservices in a Kubernetes cluster. It handles routing, load balancing, service discovery, security (TLS encryption), and monitoring, among other tasks.

**Service Mesh:** A service mesh abstracts away the complexity of microservice communications, enabling services to communicate without the application itself handling those connections. Instead of embedding communication logic in each microservice, it's moved outside to a separate layer. This becomes crucial as applications scale, with more services and more complex communication patterns.

Managing traffic and communication between services in Kubernetes can become complex, especially when dealing with multiple microservices like a frontend application, backend processing, order management, inventory analysis, and a database microservice. For instance, the frontend needs to communicate with shipping, order processing, and backend services, while these backend services also need to communicate with the database. Manually managing this communication, even with just five or six microservices, can be challenging.

As the number of microservices grows to 100 or more, the complexity increases significantly. Ensuring reliable communication, handling service discovery, and maintaining TLS encryption for secure communication between services becomes a major concern. Without a service mesh like Istio, managing this level of inter-service communication manually is not scalable and introduces several operational challenges.

**what about routing and discovery** When a new microservice is added to the architecture, it often requires communication with existing microservices, and vice versa. This introduces additional complexity as we need to ensure seamless communication between the new and old services. Each microservice might have dependencies on other services for data or functionality, and as the number of microservices grows, managing these communication paths becomes increasingly difficult.

Without proper tools or automation, handling service discovery, routing, and ensuring secure communication (like using TLS) between services manually becomes highly challenging. As the system scales with more microservices, this complexity can grow exponentially, making it harder to maintain and manage the architecture effectively.

**No proper tracking to troubleshoot the issues related to service to service communication in kubernates by default**
In a microservices architecture, troubleshooting service-to-service communication can be difficult without proper tools and mechanisms in place.
Microservices typically communicate over the network, and without observability tools (e.g., logging, distributed tracing, or monitoring), tracking how requests flow between services becomes challenging.

Issues such as latency, failed requests, or security vulnerabilities (e.g., lack of TLS encryption) can go unnoticed without proper monitoring.

The absence of an underlying mechanism to monitor and track service communication makes it difficult to identify and resolve bottlenecks or failures.

Tools like Service Meshes (e.g., Istio) or observability frameworks help secure, monitor, and troubleshoot communication, but manually managing these processes without such tools is operationally complex.

## How Istio Works for Managing Microservices Communication:

* Istio automatically injects a sidecar container called Envoy Proxy into each microservice.
* When one microservice communicates with another, the request first passes through the Envoy Proxy of the source service and then is routed to the Envoy Proxy of the destination service.
* Envoy Proxy handles the communication between microservices, making it easier to manage secure, encrypted traffic using TLS (Transport Layer Security).

* Istio provides monitoring capabilities by tracking all incoming and outgoing requests through Envoy. This allows for detailed observability of service-to-service communication, including metrics, logging, and distributed tracing.
* By using Istio, you can implement traffic management rules, enforce security policies, and monitor microservices communication without having to manually configure each service, simplifying the overall operational complexity.

### How istio start managing?
After installation of instio we need to label the namespace.so, that the namespace will be part of service-mesh
```
kubectl label namespace prod istio-injection=enabled
```
This command labels the prod namespace with istio-injection=enabled, which allows Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecars into the pods created in this namespace.

## Architecture of Istio

**Control Plane:**
The control plane is responsible for managing the configuration and policies of the service mesh. The main components include:

**Istiod:** This is the core component that combines the functionalities components like Pilot, Citadel, and Galley. It handles service discovery, traffic management, and security.

**Pilot:** Responsible for traffic management,provides service discovery and pushes configuration changes to all the envoy sidecars

**Citadel:** Manages security, including the issuance and rotation of certificates.
provides service to service and end user authentication out if the box it provides encryption of traffic between proxies using mTLS

**Galley:** Galley is Istio's configration validation,ingestion,processing and distribution component. Galley reads Yaml configuration files and converts it to Istio format.

Data Plane:
The data plane is where the actual service-to-service communication occurs. Key components include:

**Ingress Traffic:** Manages incoming requests to the services from external sources.

**Egress Traffic:** Handles outgoing requests from the services to external services.

**Envoy Proxy:** A lightweight proxy deployed alongside each service, handling traffic management, security, and observability features like logging and metrics.
