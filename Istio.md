# Istio

**Istio's Purpose:** Istio is a service mesh technology, providing management of service-to-service communications for microservices in a Kubernetes cluster. It handles routing, load balancing, service discovery, security (TLS encryption), and monitoring, among other tasks.

**Service Mesh:** A service mesh abstracts away the complexity of microservice communications, enabling services to communicate without the application itself handling those connections. Instead of embedding communication logic in each microservice, it's moved outside to a separate layer. This becomes crucial as applications scale, with more services and more complex communication patterns.
